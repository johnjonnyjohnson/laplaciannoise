Script for example of privacy loss accumulation 

This script provides an example of how Laplacian noise injection provides for privacy guarantees. 
Furthermore, we show that increasing the number of queries provides for an accumulation of privacy costs, which manifests itself in a smaller confidence interval. Consequently, an adversary is able to infer the ground truth after a number of queries.
